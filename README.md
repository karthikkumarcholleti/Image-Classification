# Image-Classification (Face and Eye Detection using OpenCV)
This project demonstrates how to detect faces and eyes of humans in images, videos, and real-time video streams using the front camera. It utilizes OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade classifiers for both face and eye detection.
# Introduction
This project uses OpenCV to detect human faces and eyes using Haar Cascade Classifiers. The program can be used to:

Detect faces and eyes in static images
Detect faces and eyes in video files
Perform real-time face and eye detection using the front camera of your device
# Features
Face Detection: Detects human faces in images, videos, and real-time camera feed.
Eye Detection: Detects eyes within the detected faces.
Real-time Detection: Pops up the front camera, detects faces and eyes in real-time.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the necessary dependencies
3. Ensure that OpenCV is installed
4. Download the Haar Cascade Classifier XML files from OpenCV's GitHub repository
# Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
Numpy
Webcam (for real-time detection)
